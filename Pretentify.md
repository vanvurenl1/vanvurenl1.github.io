## Pretentify

**Project description:** This project was created by a team with myself and my peers Emma Zimmerman, Joe Bartlett, and Kelby Sandvick. We wanted to create an application which used the Spotify API and Flask, a framework for web development in Python. Spotify does not presently offer statistical analysis of listening habits, so we used data gathered from the API and created a graph based on songs added by genre. I personally had my hands in a lot of the features, but I spend most of my time in backend Flask development, data modelling, and the frontend. 

**Skills:**
* Python
* Spotify API
* OAuth2 for User Authentication
* Data Analytics
* HTML
* CSS
* Flask
* Web Development
* Agile Scrum
